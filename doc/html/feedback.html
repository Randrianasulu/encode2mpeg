Thank you for the great effort you make in producing such GPL tools for
some of us.<br>

[...] MPEG mode works great, and I'm also able to create good VCDs and
SVCDs using encode2mpeg. The documentation for MPEG mode and creating
(S)VCDs is extensive and useful.<br>

Thank you very much! With your work, I first find a software in linux
which works even much better than any software in MS windows. I have
tried many video convert in MS windows before, including EOvideo,
TMPGEnc, RM Converter, WinAVI etc., many of them also have a/v problem.
Among them, I prefer TMPGEnc, it has no a/v problem and is more robust,
but it is more slower(about 2~3 times) than yours(in mpeg mode).<br>

A BIG thank you for providing us encode2mpeg. You saved me after 3 days
trying to create a VCD using ffmpeg, transcode, etc etc etc. Now I can
burn some VCDs and some DVDs with movies of my little baby daughter. :-)<br>

Thanks a lot for putting the effort into putting this tool together. It
was just what I was looking for.<br>

I'm glad I found a script like yours for my SVCD needs; there are
multiple other programs for that kind of job but it seems they all are
missing something (size estimation, n-pass encoding, ...). Thanks again
for this script that is from now on my day-to-day tool :)<br>

Thank you for encode2mpeg, it's been very very helpful in getting up to
speed with video transcoding. And the documentation is really superb.<br>

I'm writing this post just to thank you for this nice tool. I was
studying how use mplayer this way, and you gave me a perfect solution
and good material to study, at the same time.<br>

I have used your encode2mpeg script and I would like to thank you for
it.<br>

Thanks again for your great software. I use it quite a bit.<br>

Thank you very very much for your work and time. Its a very useful and
helpful script!<br>

I found encode2mpeg very useful to me as it saved me a lot of time
allowing me to do very simple things without having to read loads of
documentations, and I thank you very much for that.<br>

Thanks for the wonderful script. It made many complex tasks easy.<br>

Congratulations! You did a great job, thank you! After many day
googling I have found encode2mpeg, the only Linux tool, that really can
create a vob file containing the needed video/audio/subtitle tracks and
a working DVD structure from it. Mplayer dumps streams without NAV
sectors (VOBU), mplex isn't able to multiplex subtitles, Freevo with
DVDcopy plugin doesn't work etc.<br>
