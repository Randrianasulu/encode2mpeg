                Welcome to encode2mpeg

This program is a frontend to mplayer/mencoder and to mjpegtools.
It is able to convert any kind of video that mplayer can play in
a format suitable for VCD/SVCD/DVD, plus it can create (MPEG) AVI.

The capabilities of encode2mpeg are increasing with every release
Please read the rest of the documentation for an updated description.

What you need:

MPlayer 1.0rc1 (http://www.mplayerhq.hu/)
mjpegtools 1.8.0 or later (http://mjpeg.sourceforge.net/)

The following programs are optional: if you don't have all of them
encode2mpeg can still do a partial or complete job:

	lame (http://lame.sourceforge.net/)
	toolame (http://www.planckenergy.com/)
	MPEG-2 Audio Simulation Software Distribution 10
	  (ftp://ftp.tnt.uni-hannover.de/pub/MPEG/audio/mpeg2/software/technical_report/dist10.tar.gz)
	avimerge, avisplit[transcode] (http://www.transcoding.org/)
	rar (http://www.exit1.org/dvdrip/contrib/rarlnx271.sfx.bin)
	vcdimager (http://www.vcdimager.org/)
	dvdauthor (http://dvdauthor.sourceforge.net/)
	cdrdao (http://cdrdao.sourceforge.net/)
	growisofs (http://fy.chalmers.se/~appro/linux/DVD+RW/)
	ImageMagick 5.5.4-6.0.7 or 6.1.3-6.1.6 or 6.1.8-latest (http://www.imagemagick.org/)
	vobcopy (http://lpn.rnbhq.org/projects/c/c.shtml)

For graphic to text subtitle conversion you need
	    at least one of the following ocr engines:
	tesseract (http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/)
	gocr (http://jocr.sourceforge.net/)
	ocrad (http://www.gnu.org/software/ocrad/ocrad.html)
	    one of the following terminal emulator:
	rxvt-unicode (http://software.schmorp.de/#rxvt-unicode)
	rxvt (http://www.rxvt.org/) 
	Eterm (http://www.eterm.org/)
	aterm (http://www.afterstep.org/aterm.php)
	konsole (http://konsole.kde.org/)
	gnome-terminal (http://directory.fsf.org/iface/gnome/gnome-terminal.html)
       

The following programs are MPEG Multichannel Audio related and
probably you do not need them. But for particular encoding configurations
encode2mpeg may require them and it will issue an error message if they 
are not installed:

	mctoolame (http://mctoolame.sourceforge.net/)
        sox (http://sox.sourceforge.net/)
        ch_wave (http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/speech_tools/)


PATCHES:

MEncoder 1.0rc1 has a bug that makes encoding in Mpeg Mode with bframes fail with 
the error message:
	Floating point exception
The included patch fix the bug. Recomended.
$ cd /path_to_mplayer_source/MPlayer-1.0rc1
$ patch -p1 < /path_to_encode2mpeg_source/patch_mplayer1.0rc1_bframes_fix


Included is a patch for dvdauthor that add new features to spumux/spuunmux and
fix some bugs. The patch is recomended if you use the option -addsub because it
makes the subtitle copying process a lot faster and more reliable. It is also
necessary if you want to copy subtitles from a SVCD.
$ cd /path_to_dvdauthor_source/dvdauthor-0.6.14
$ patch -p1 < /path_to_encode2mpeg_source/patch_dvdauthor0.6.14_raw


In Mpeg Mode a VCD 16/9 PAL movie will be created with aspect 2 instead of the
correct aspect 3. The included patch fix this small bug.
$ cd /path_to_mplayer_source/MPlayer-1.0rc1
$ patch -p1 < /path_to_encode2mpeg_source/patch_mplayer1.0rc1_mpeg1_aspect16_9_PAL
Direct Mode is not affected by this bug.


Current MPlayer only print the following message if a SVCD subtitle is found
in the MPEG stream:
	Unknown 0x1BD substream: 0x70
The included patch will let MPlayer print the following messages instead:
	==> Found (currently unsupported) svcd subtitle: 0
It is necessary to apply the patch if you are copying SVCD subtitles with the
option -addsub copy.
$ cd /path_to_mplayer_source/MPlayer-1.0rc1
$ patch -p1 < /path_to_encode2mpeg_source/patch_mplayer1.0rc1_svcdsubsinfo


Please report any problem or suggestion to:

Program download:

Documentation:
See doc/encode2mpeg.html or run 'encode2mpeg -doc'

Installation:
In order to install the executables and the documentation in /usr/local,
run, as root, ./install
If you want to install the program in another place, run, not necessarily
as root, ./install --prefix=<PATH>
If you want to install also the programs present in the directory TOOLS,
add the option --tools
In order to set the default browser you wish to use with encode2mpeg, set
the variable BROWSER during the installation:
BROWSER=firefox ./install --tools --prefix=<PATH>


MPEG-2 Audio Simulation Software Distribution 10:
You need to install this software if you want to encode
MPEG Multichannel Audio or MPEG2 Layer I audio.
Here is the list of commands to run in order to install it:
    Download the source file dist10.tar.gz form:
        ftp://ftp.tnt.uni-hannover.de/pub/MPEG/audio/mpeg2/software/technical_report/dist10.tar.gz
    or
        http://www.mp3-tech.org/programmer/encoding.html
    untar, compile and install:
        tar vvfzx dist10.tar.gz
        patch -p0 < /path_to_encode2mpeg_source/patch_dist10
        cd dist10/lsf/encoder
        ./configure
        make
        strip encode
        chmod a+x tables
        chmod -R a+r tables
        cp -r tables encode <directory in the PATH>
        cd ../../mc/encoder
        make
        strip musicin
        cp musicin <directory in the PATH>
        chmod a+x tables
        chmod -R a+r tables
        cp -r tables <directory in the PATH>/tablesmc
# note the change of the directory name from tables to tablesmc
        cd ../decoder
        make
        strip musicout
        cp musicout <directory in the PATH>
        cd ../../tool/pcm2aiff
        make
        strip pcm2aiff
        cp pcm2aiff <directory in the PATH>
    the binary 'encode' needs to find the directory 'tables' and
    the binaries 'musicin' and 'musicout' need to find the 
    directory 'tablesmc'. If you copy tables and tablesmc in 
    the same directory as encode, musicin and musicout,
    encode2mpeg will work fine. Otherwise you need to set the
    environment variable MPEGTABLES with the correct path.
    Example: if tables is in /usr/local/etc/mpeg then execute
        export MPEGTABLES=/usr/local/etc/mpeg/tables
    before running encode2mpeg, or similarly
        export MPEGTABLES=/usr/local/etc/mpeg/tablesmc


CD-i:
CD-i compatibility is required for a VCD to be White Book compliant.
encode2mpeg can create CD-i compatible VCD with few steps:
    download the CD-i application from:
        http://www.vcdimager.org/pub/vcdimager/vcdimager-0.4/vcd_on_cdi_411.zip
    unzip the archive:
        unzip vcd_on_cdi_411.zip
    move CDI_IMAG.RTF,CDI_TEXT.FNT,CDI_VCD.APP in a directory you like:
        mv CDI_* <path to CD-i application>
    for CD-i compatibility add this option to encode2mpeg
        -cdi <path to CD-i application>


ch_wave:
In order to install the program ch_wave, you need to download
The Edinburgh Speech Tools Library from:
    http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/downloads/festival/1.95/speech_tools-1.2.95-beta.tar.gz
or
    http://festvox.org/packed/festival/1.95/speech_tools-1.2.95-beta.tar.gz
or
    http://festvox.org/packed/festival/1.96/speech_tools-1.2.96-beta.tar.gz
    untar, compile and install (compilation takes a lot of time):
        tar vvfzx speech_tools-1.2.95-beta.tar.gz
        cd speech_tools
        ./configure
        make
        strip main/ch_wave
        cp main/ch_wave <directory in the PATH>
