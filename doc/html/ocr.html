<h2 style="text-align: center;">SPU and Vobsub subtitles conversion<br>
</h2>
Since release 0.6.3 encode2mpeg supports the conversion of graphic
subtitles (SPU streams and Vobsub) to text subtitles (SubViewer). In
order to
achive
this goal, encode2mpeg needs a good ocr engine. Currently the following
ocr engines are supported: <a
 href="http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/">tesseract</a>, <a
 href="http://jocr.sourceforge.net/">gocr</a> and <a
 href="http://www.gnu.org/software/ocrad/ocrad.html">ocrad</a>. Each of
them has its strongness and weakness and none of them can, at the
moment, totally
replace the others.<br>
Subtitles conversion is enabled with the option <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">-ocr</span> and the list of subtitles
to convert is selected with the option <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">-addsub</span>. For SPU subtitles
specify the source stream (DVD, SVCD, mpeg)<span
 style="font-family: monospace;"></span>,
for vobsub subtitles use the option <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">-vobsubsrc</span>. With the option <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">-addsla</span> you can override the
automatic detection of the language id. Subtitle conversion is possible
only in Avi
Mode, therefore the encode2mpeg command line must include the option
<span style="font-family: monospace;">-avionly</span>. <span
 style="font-family: monospace;"></span><span
 style="font-family: monospace;"></span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
Example:<br>
<pre>encode2mpeg -o movie dvd://1 -avionly -ocr -addsub 0,1</pre>
This will create the files <span style="font-family: monospace;">movie.tesseract_0_en.srt</span>
and <span style="font-family: monospace;">movie.tesseract_1_de.srt</span>
assuming that tesseract was used and the language id of the two
subtitles were english and german.<br>
<br>
The following options can be used for subtitle conversion:<br>
<pre>-ocropts I:II:III:IV:V:VI:VII:VIII:IX</pre>
I - select the ocr engine: auto (default), tesseract, gocr, ocrad,
ocradi (ocrad with inverted image levels)<br>
II - text to append to the name specifyed with
-o, the default is <span style="font-family: monospace;">%o_%i_%l </span>(see
below)<br>
III - format of the subtitle file created: unix (default), dos<br>
IV - add <span style="font-weight: bold;">;1</span><span
 style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;"></span> at the end
of the subtitle file name: off (default), on<br>
V - extension of the subtitle file name, the default is <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">srt</span><br>
VI - edit each subtitle that the ocr engine has converted: off
(default), on<br>
VII - terminal used for subtitle editing: auto (default), urxvt
(rxvt-unicode), rxvt, Eterm, aterm, konsole, gnome-terminal<br>
VIII - preferred size and position for the terminal used for subtitle
editing, the default is <span style="font-family: monospace;">do not
set a preferred size and position</span><br>
IX - trim the source subtitle image: off
(default), on<br>
<br>
If the first suboption is auto, encode2mpeg
will look for a supported ocr engine in the following order:
tesseract, gocr, ocrad, and will use the first one he founds (ocradi is
never selected automatically). Ocradi is ocrad with inverted image
levels. It appears that
most of the times this option is required for ocrad in order to work
properly. <br>
The second suboption define a text string to be added to the subtitle
file name before the suffix. In the text string some combination of
text characters are expanded as following:<br>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">%o</span> is replaced with the
name of the ocr engine used</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">%i</span> is replaced with the
index of the subtitle converted: first subtitle is 0,
second is 1 and so on</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">%l</span> is replaced with the
iso 639 language code as automatically detected by
encode2mpeg or selected with -addsla</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">%%</span> is replaced with a
single % character</li>
  <li>all the other characters are left unchanged<br>
  </li>
</ul>
Because the ocr engine is not 100% error free, you may want to check
and/or edit each subtitle just converted before the final subtitle file
is created. Use the sixth suboption in order to activate subtitle
editing. During subtitle editing a new terminal window running <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">vi</span> will
be opened. In the terminal window you will have on top the text file
created by
the ocr engine ready to be edited with vi, below there will be the
graphic subtitle image used by the ocr engine for the conversion as a
reference for you. See an example <a href="../images/ocrterm.png">here</a>.
When finished, exit vi
with the usual commands: <span style="font-weight: bold;">:wq</span>
or <span style="font-weight: bold;">ZZ</span>. If the seventh
suboption is auto, encode2mpeg will look for a terminal compiled with
support for backgroundPixmap in the following order: urxvt, rxvt,
Eterm, aterm, konsole, gnome-terminal and will use the first one he
founds. During subtitle
editing, the terminal that is opened is placed in a place choosen by
the window manager. You may override that and also specify a different
size providing a geometry argument as eighth suboption. If the spu
subtitles are encoded in full size (720x576) the graphic text in the
terminal window may be outside the window boundaries, instead of
resizing the window use the nineth suboption to make the text visible.<br>
<br>
You
can omit the default
values
from the argument of <span style="font-family: monospace;">-ocropts</span>.
For example:<br>
<pre>-ocropts ocrad::dos:on<br></pre>
will use ocrad as ocr engine, terminate the lines with cr/lf
and end the file name with ;1. The other parameters will keep their
default values. <br>
<h3>OCR engines<br>
</h3>
By the time encode2mpeg 0.6.3 has been released, the status of the
supported ocr engines was the following:<br>
<ul>
  <li>tessercat usually recognises 97% or more of the
input, undestands italics text, but only
supports ASCII characters (it should change quite soon).</li>
  <li>gocr has an higher error rate, understands italics and non ASCII
text.<br>
  </li>
  <li>ocrad has an high error rate, understands non ASCII text but it
has more trouble with italics. </li>
</ul>
My recomendation is to use tesseract unless you need support for non
ASCII text.<br>
If tesseract does not seem to work, use <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">./configure --with-libtiff=no</span>
during tessercact's compilation/installation process.<br>
