Since release 0.5.3 encode2mpeg supports Mpeg Multichannel Audio
format.
This means that
you can have a standard SVCD with more than 2 audio channels per audio
stream. You can therefore convert a DVD with AC3 5.1 audio to SVCD and
keep all the 5.1 audio channels. If your audio equipment is not MPEG
Multichannel compliant, you will hear a normal stereo sound.<br>
In order to select MPEG Multichannel audio add the options: <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">-mp2
musicin -mpegchannels 6</span> to your encode2mpeg command line. In
Mpeg Mode
you need also to add <span style="font-weight: bold;">-replex</span>
and use <span style="font-weight: bold;">-encode 0:m:i</span>.
Remember, it makes
sense to use these options only if your source video has more than 2
audio channels in the audio stream. In order to mantain a reasonable
audio quality you
should keep the abr to 384 (it is the default for multichannel audio).
You may also need to reduce the vbr to a lower value (2355) in order to
keep the total bitrate within the SVCD specifications.<br>
<br>
Example Direct Mode:<br>
<pre>encode2mpeg -o SVCD5.1 dvd://1 -svcd -n p -aid 128 -mp2 musicin -mpegchannels 6<br></pre>
Example Mpeg Mode:<br>
<pre>encode2mpeg -o SVCD5.1 dvd://1 -svcd -n p -aid 128 -mp2 musicin -mpegchannels 6 -mpeg -encode 0:3:2 -replex<br></pre>
If you use Mpeg Multichannel Audio encoding on regular basis, please
contact me.
There may be still some adjustement that can be done.
<h2 align="left">How to test your audio equipment</h2>
You can easily test if your audio equipment is MPEG Multichannel
compliant:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Make a Multichannel Audio SVCD<br>
Download this <a href="http://hypercubemx.free.fr/SVCDTest.mp2">MPEG
Multichannel audio track</a> called SVCDTest.mp2 and make a SVCD with
encode2mpeg:<br>
    <pre>encode2mpeg -o TEST -testmca SVCDTest.mp2 -svcd -n &lt;NORM&gt;</pre>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Put the SVCD in your hardware player.<br>
    <ul>
      <li>If your equipment is MPEG
Multichannel compliant, the voice annoucement and the accompanying
noise test tone for each channel should come out of the corresponding
speaker. Depending on your setup, the deep-bass LFE test tone
may emerge from your subwoofer (if
any) and/or from one or more of the front speakers. The voice
annoucement for the LFE channel will come out of the left speaker
only.
If you hear no deep-bass test tone at all when your hear &#8220;LFE&#8221;
annoucement, the bass-management controls may need adjustment or your
speakers are not capable&nbsp; of producing sounds below 70Hz. Do not
forget to disable your dolby surround decoder (and any DSP effects) if
you want a real MPEG multichannel compliance test.<br>
      </li>
      <li>If your equipment is not MPEG
Multichannel compliant, you will hear the audio only from the left and
right speakers.</li>
      <li>If your equipment is not MPEG
Multichannel compliant, but it supports Dolby Surround Prologic, then,
after enabling the dolby surround decoder, you should be
able to listen the sound from the left, center and right speakers. The
surround speakers may also work acting as if they were a single
speaker (the same sound will came from the left and right surround
speakers). The LFE speaker should not work.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Software requirements</h2>
In order to make MPEG Multichannel Audio you need to install the MPEG-2
Audio Simulation Software Distribution 10. The <a href="../README">README</a>
contains step by step instructions about its installation.
