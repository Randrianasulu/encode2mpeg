<h2 style="text-align: center;">Configuration file<br>
</h2>
You can put in the configuration file <span style="font-weight: bold;">$HOME/.encode2mpegrc</span>
the options which will be used every time encode2mpeg is run. The
syntax of the configuration files is identical to the command line
options: put in a single line the options that you would type during a
run. There is however a limitation: in the configuration file are not
permitted arguments containing spaces or quotes. Example .encode2mpegrc
content:<br>
<pre>-mpegfixaspect -cdburndevice /dev/cdrecorder</pre>
If you have a configuration file but you do not want to use it during a
run, add the options <span style="font-family: monospace;">-norc</span>
to your command line. Options in the configuration file are processed
before the options on the command line, therefore the command line
options override the configuration file options.<br>
<br>
There is no explicit support for the usage of an alternate
configuration file, but it is easy to emulate it:<br>
<pre>encode2mpeg -norc $(&lt;myrcfile) &lt;options&gt;<br></pre>
just put your rc file (myrcfile in the previous example) before the
other options and do not forget to use <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">-norc</span> otherwise the standard rc
file will be used too. If your shell do not support the syntax <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">$(&lt;myrcfile)</span> use <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">`cat myrcfile`</span> instead.<br>
