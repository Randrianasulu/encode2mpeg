<h2 style="text-align: center;">Different source videos on a single
VCD/SVCD/DVD<br>
</h2>
Sometimes you would like to put on a single disk videos from different
source streams. Since 0.4.1 encode2mpeg support this feature.<br>
<br>
For each source stream add the option -video followed by the
argument(s) necessary to completely identify the video stream. Example:<br>
<pre>encode2mpeg -o &lt;NAME&gt; &lt;common options&gt; -video video1.avi -video video2.ogm -ss 60 -frames 2500 -video dvd://1 -chapter 3-4</pre>
encode2mpeg will create a mpeg for each source video and then the
binary image or the DVD filesystem. There will be as many chapters as
the number of source videos. The DVD created in this way is
single-title multi-chapters (for a multi-title DVD see <a
 href="menu.html">here</a>). The
VCD/SVCD is multi-tracks (with the disadvantage
that it does not play seamless between tracks). Since 0.5.5 it is
possible to make a single-track
multi-entry-points VCD/SVCD, but with the following limitations: only
single audio streams without subtitles are permitted (therefore this
limitations apply only to SVCD). In order to use this feature, add the
option <span style="font-family: monospace;">-addchapter&nbsp;copy</span>
to your command line before the first <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">-video</span> option. In case you use
the option <span style="font-family: monospace;">-stdvid</span>, the
option <span style="font-family: monospace;">-addchapter&nbsp;copy</span>
is automatically enabled; in order to disable it (and make multi-tracks
VCD/SVCD) add the option <span style="font-family: monospace;">-nochapter</span>
after the option <span style="font-family: monospace;">-stdvid</span>.<br>
<br>
If you have many source videos (10, 20, 50 or even more), you can
use an alternate syntax:<br>
<pre>encode2mpeg -o &lt;NAME&gt; &lt;common options&gt; -videos video1.avi video2.ogm movie*.mpg</pre>
The source videos must be present on the disk and each video will be
fully converted (it is not possible to select a part of the video with
-ss, -frames, -endpos etc.).<br>
