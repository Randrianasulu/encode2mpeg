<h2 style="text-align: center;">Verify the content of a burned disk<br>
</h2>
Normally encode2mpeg creates an mpeg stream, then a binary image
and finally burns
the image on the selectred support (CD or DVD). The burn process may
not be error free. A DVD burner may burn a disks with corrupted data
due to a bad media; the burn process shows no errors,
but the disk content is not 100% identical to the source image. In
order to compare the image of the burned media with the one present on
the hard disk, add the option -verify to your command line. Example:<br>
<pre>encode2mpeg -o TITLE -n p source.avi -stdvid 9 -verify</pre>
If any file on the burned disk is different from the correspondent file
present on the hard disk, there will be an error message in the log
file. I recomend to use -verify all the times you burn disks with
encode2mpeg.<br>

</h2>
There exist many hardware DVD players able to play DivX and MPEG-4
streams
and VCD/SVCD mpeg streams burned with a ISO/UDF filesystem on the DVD
media. With encode2mpeg it is possible to burn such streams with the
option -burniso or -burnudf. The stream just encoded, avi or mpeg, will
be burned
on the DVD disk preserving any other streams already present. If the
media is DVD RW, you can erase any previous file already on the disk
adding the option -blank. The option -burnudf creates a disk image
bigger than the one created
with -burniso, therefore -burniso should be preferred except if the
file to burn is bigger than 2GB, in such case only -burnudf can be
used. The options -burniso and -burnudf are valid
only if
you are
not burning a standard VCD/SVCD/DVD. It means that one of: -avionly,
-mpegonly, -imageonly, -isoonly, must be present together with
-burniso/-burnudf.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
<pre>encode2mpeg -o TITLE dvd://1 -avionly -encode 3:2:2 -burniso -verify</pre>
It is, of course, possible to combine -verify with -burniso/-burnudf.<br>
